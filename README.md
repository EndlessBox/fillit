# fillit
Fillit is a programme (kind of like Tetris) when u give the program a number of tetriminos's and he try to put those tetriminosin the smallest square possible.
the programme will take every input and he will replace the '#' with and alphabetic sign depending on their order :D ! 
* there is the output of this tetriminos in the end of this  README file . Enjoy .
u will find a valid test in the file test.
Thank you for your time !
